# Features
-[ ] create new tours
    - a tour consists of:
      - name
      - tour description
      - from
      - to
      - transport type
      - tour distance*
      - estimated time*
      - route information* (image with tour map)
      - \* image, distance and time fetch via API
-[ ] tours are managed in a list and can be (CRUD)
-[ ] a user can create a tour log for a tour
  - multiple tour logs can belong to one tour
  - a tour log consists of:
    - date/time
    - comment
    - difficulty
    - total time
    - rating
-[ ] tour logs are managed in a list and can be (CRUD)
-[ ] user input is validated
-[ ] full text search in tour and tour log data
-[ ] automatically computed tour attributes
  - popularity (based on number of logs)
  - child friendliness (based on difficulty, total times?, distance)
  - full text search also considers the computed values (so when searching this values are used to rank???)
-[ ] import and export of tour data (all tour data or specific tour?)
-[ ] user can generate two types of reports 
  - tour report (contains information of a single tour and all its connected tour logs)
  - summarize report (statistical analysis for each tour provides the average time, distance, and rating over all connected tour logs)
-[ ] unique feature (think about later on!)
